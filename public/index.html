    <button class="accordion">> The Weaver Family<div class="right">early childhood</div></button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>Before I was born my dad was close friends with a family that adopted a few children (2 girls + 1 boy) from Sierra Leon.  While I was little these were the only non-white people I interacted with on any real level, looking back at it this is one place in particular where the concept of race began to become a taboo topic.  The reason for this is that I was told that two of these three that were adopted, the boy and one of the girls, were old enough to remember the hardships and struggles that happened that led to them being adopted by a family halfway across the world.  This meant that talking about what it was like for them before coming to America was a taboo for us, and similarly their racial identity got lumped into this taboo in my young mind (I’ve known them my whole life) so the conversation eventually became a taboo for me.</p>

    <p>Another family that mine was close with was a family from Argentina, who has actually gone back since as missionaries.  I think that looking back this began to condition me to view America as above other nations, as it was always clear that they intended to return to Argentina as missionaries. I had thought that because people were coming to America so they could help their home nations then I decided that America must have been better than those other nations.</p>

    <button class="accordion">> My	Grandmother<div class="right">early childhood</div></button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>My paternal Grandmother lives in Newport Beach, my Grandfather died while I was very young and due to his position she doesn’t need to worry about finances all that much.  Her presence in my life has been somewhat constant as we’d visit her about once a year and make a big trip of it where we’d take advantage of her position to have a vacation in southern California by doing things such as Disneyland or Catalina island.  All of this did impact my view of primarily the latinx community as they often served as maids in my grandmothers community, or otherwise were employed as servers or other menial jobs.</p>

    <button class="accordion">> Moving to California<div class="right">Moving Around</div></button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>While I was little, we uprooted ourselves from Buffalo New York, and moved all the way to Sacramento California for about 3 years.  These years were really hard for me as I was constantly an outsider, had issues with bullying, from both students and teachers, and ultimately didn’t have many friends.  The few people I would look back and call my friends ended up being a group of non-white kids who may have been similarly pushed into the outgroup, given the school’s very white suburban culture.  This validated a more colorblind mindset, as it made me feel more similar to these people due to sharing certain experiences as I saw that it wasn’t an issue about race with them as I thought I faced similar issues to what they did, despite being different races.</p>
