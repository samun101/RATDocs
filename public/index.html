    <button class="accordion">> The Weaver Family<div class="right">early childhood</div></button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>Before I was born my dad was close friends with a family that adopted a few children (2 girls + 1 boy) from Sierra Leon.  While I was little these were the only non-white people I interacted with on any real level, looking back at it this is one place in particular where the concept of race began to become a taboo topic.  The reason for this is that I was told that two of these three that were adopted, the boy and one of the girls, were old enough to remember the hardships and struggles that happened that led to them being adopted by a family halfway across the world.  This meant that talking about what it was like for them before coming to America was a taboo for us, and similarly their racial identity got lumped into this taboo in my young mind (I’ve known them my whole life) so the conversation eventually became a taboo for me.</p>

    <div class="panel">
    <p>Another family that mine was close with was a family from Argentina, who has actually gone back since as missionaries.  I think that looking back this began to condition me to view America as above other nations, as it was always clear that they intended to return to Argentina as missionaries. I had thought that because people were coming to America so they could help their home nations then I decided that America must have been better than those other nations.</p>

    <button class="accordion">> My	Grandmother<div class="right">early childhood</div></button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>My paternal Grandmother lives in Newport Beach, my Grandfather died while I was very young and due to his position she doesn’t need to worry about finances all that much.  Her presence in my life has been somewhat constant as we’d visit her about once a year and make a big trip of it where we’d take advantage of her position to have a vacation in southern California by doing things such as Disneyland or Catalina island.  All of this did impact my view of primarily the Latinx community as they often served as maids in my grandmothers community, or otherwise were employed as servers or other menial jobs.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">> Moving to California<div class="right">Moving Around</div></button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>While I was little, we uprooted ourselves from Buffalo New York, and moved all the way to Sacramento California for about 3 years.  These years were really hard for me as I was constantly an outsider, had issues with bullying, from both students and teachers, and ultimately didn’t have many friends.  The few people I would look back and call my friends ended up being a group of non-white kids who may have been similarly pushed into the outgroup, given the school’s very white suburban culture.  This validated a more colorblind mindset, as it made me feel more similar to these people due to sharing certain experiences as I saw that it wasn’t an issue about race with them as I thought I faced similar issues to what they did, despite being different races.</p>

    <button class="accordion">> Time with Cousin<div class="right">Moving Around</div></button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>A few years after moving to California we again packed up and moved back east, this time as we didn’t have a destination yet in mind so we stayed with family in rural Indiana.  At this time my aunt and uncle did a lot of work to take care of me and my family, but my cousin made this time far harder than anyone would have liked.  He carried with him a level of entitlement that even as a child I was uncomfortable with, and can now see has turned me against those with similar tendencies to him.  This has made me endlessly uncomfortable with what I describe as a “rural culture” that carries extensive amounts of entitlement and selfishness that I now recognize to be associated with this country’s history of racism.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">> Moving to Pittsburgh<div class="right">Pittsburgh</div></button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>When I moved to Pittsburgh we moved into an “intentional Christian community” where a group of white Christians chose to live together in an area with a history of gangs and redlining.  This was jarring, it put me in an area where I was constantly around these effects of racism and decades, if not centuries, of intentional discrimination but not truly a part of it.  I look back and can see how this had started teaching me about the effects and the realities of what such constant discrimination can have, although I didn’t realize at the time.</p>

    <button class="accordion">>	Gentrifying area<div class="right">Pittsburgh</div></button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>My neighborhood, East Liberty, in Pittsburgh has a long history of redlining where it was intentionally targeted because of its black population, as well as the building of low-income housing apartments to relocate individuals who’ve been kicked out by other neighborhoods development.  We moved into a very poor neighborhood, but development was already underway, a Target was being built nearby, Google was looking at establishing offices in Pittsburgh in the neighborhood, and Pittsburgh’s tech industry was beginning to explode, and very soon after the neighborhood became a perfect place to move to if you were coming to Pittsburgh to work in the tech industry.  This led to rapid gentrification, where a home that I believe sold for less than $100,000 around the time I came to Pittsburgh sold for $500,000 by the time I had begun my senior year of high-school.  I was aware of all of this, and it really was one of the early things that showed me how complex these issues are and how it feels like there’s sometimes not a solution to these issues.</p>

    <button class="accordion">> Middle School<div class="right">Schooling</div></button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>I went to a private Christian middle school, there was 1 black girl in the school who attended with me for all three years, and two boys who attended for only 1 year each.  While I really don’t remember much about them specifically, I do more clearly remember how one of the teachers was particularly strict with them and seemed to carry some bad attitudes about power and control.  At the time I had just developed a strong dislike of this particular teacher, and I really am unsure of how this effected my view on race and ethnicity.  This whole period also began to make me aware of race though as this really is my first-time remembering interacting with people and recognizing that they were of a different race, although I didn’t really know, or care, what it meant.</p>

    <button class="accordion">> Early high-school<div class="right">Schooling</div></button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>After graduating 8th grade I moved into a magnet high-school.  This meant that I opted to attend and had to fill an application, but it was otherwise treated as a public high-school due to me being geographically located in the district.  Because this is an urban high-school it had a larger black population than I had ever been involved with before, but because of the magnet process and the application necessary it only ended up being about 50-50 black-white population.  This meant that in my freshman year I became very aware of my race, and began to grow close to people of other races, but I always viewed it as a cultural thing, removing race and ethnicity from it altogether.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">> Late high-school<div class="right">Schooling</div></button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>As I began to learn more and more about issues to deal with race and ethnicity, being exposed to these issues for the first time through sociology, literature, and women’s studies classes I began to ask more questions.  This turned out to be an inappropriate response to what I was apparently being told, and as my high-school career went on I ended up being pushed away from the conversation by the people who were declaring its importance.  This ultimately turned into a level of bullying and aggression that I didn’t know how to handle, which led me to just isolate myself from the conversation as a whole, intentionally removing myself for my own sake.   This has resulted in some kind of repressed memories and I’m aware that I’ve almost rewritten things that I can’t bring myself to unpack, for my own mental health.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">> Westmont College<div class="right">Schooling</div></button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>I had gone through most of my college career aware, and apathetic to my own race and identity, intentionally not getting involved in anything and actively distancing myself from the conversation due to my personal history.  This started to change with the conversation about White Jesus, where I saw it grow into a massive issue on campus where people felt far stronger than I would have ever expected them to.  This, as well as growing closer to people involved from other reasons, pushed me to have to start to have these conversations.  Because people here are no longer approaching the conversation as strongly as they were in high-school I was able to actually learn and end up taking this class in learning about race and my own identity.</p>
