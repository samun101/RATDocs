    <p>Before I was born my dad was close friends with a family that adopted a few children (2 girls + 1 boy) from Sierra Leon.  While I was little these were the only non-white people I interacted with on any real level, looking back at it this is one place in particular where the concept of race began to become a taboo topic.  The reason for this is that I was told that two of these three that were adopted, the boy and one of the girls, were old enough to remember the hardships and struggles that happened that led to them being adopted by a family halfway across the world.  This meant that talking about what it was like for them before coming to America was a taboo for us, and similarly their racial identity got lumped into this taboo in my young mind (Iâ€™ve known them my whole life) so the conversation eventually became a taboo for me.</p>
